Inspired by [Stanford CS230 blog post](https://cs230.stanford.edu/blog/pytorch/), I created this repository to use as a template for my ML projects. `util.py` will be updated with helper functions through time.

Main libraries:
* [PyTorch](pytorch.org/): as the main ML framework
* [Comet.ml](https://www.comet.ml): tracking code, logging experiments
* [OmegaConf](https://omegaconf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): for managing configuration files
